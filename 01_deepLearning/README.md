In this module, we introduce deep learning, which is a technique within machine learning. It tends to outperform other techniques when there is a large amount of data. 

This tutorial works through a supervised learning problem, specifically classification. 

Imagine you are making a machine for the post office that will automatically sort mail by zip code. The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains thousands of examples of handwritten numbers, with each digit labeled 0-9. We will use deep learning to create a function that classifies each image of one number as a digit 0-9.
